	* Fixed problem in Interior Zone Inspector not saving changes correctly.
	* Fixed multiple poissible rendering issues in LWRP/URP.
	* Fixed possible error in bilateral blur shader on metal.

	* Optimizations for time slice rendered reflection probes.
	* More work for upcoming HDRP support.

	* Added option to update the default environment reflection cubemap with the texture of global reflection probe. (For instanced indirect rendered material reflections)
	* Added a new list for additional cameras for URP and HDRP. You need to add your cameras here if your want to render Enviro effects on these.
